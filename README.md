### Optimal decision making under uncertainty to discovery new drugs
In drug discovery, chemists and biologists need to decide on which drugs to test next. This is a particularly challenging task because (1) we are uncertainty about the relationship between molecules and their activity and (2) testing a new drug can cost many hours of labors and many dollar of scientific research. Bayesian machine learning algorithms, including Bayesian optimization, active learning, Bayes optimal experimental design, etc., are perfect candidate for these purposes.
